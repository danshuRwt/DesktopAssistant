# DesktopAssistant
A simple desktop assistant using Python. Works on simple matching command strings.
I have named the assistant as 'Suhani', so obviously it's a female assistant.
It simpley automates some the tasks i usually do, like opening some IDE or playing the same music or searching youtube or wikipedia or sending an email.
